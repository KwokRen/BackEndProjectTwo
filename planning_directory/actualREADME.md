#### Description

Finding it hard to follow through on plans for a exercise regimen? Never fear, OnTrack is here to keep you on track! OnTrack is a free website application that you can use to keep track of your routines and meals for the day. 

Users can navigate to the exercise tracker, and create up to three routines per day. In addition to the routines, you can describe the difficulty, the amount of sets and reps you plan to do and even add a link to an instructional video! While you create your exercise, you can also implement your meals for the day (which will be shown in the food tracker below the exercise tracker). The best part is, you can create multiple plans for different days. Cross off any exercises you finish and you can edit or delete any entries anytime!

The website is made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the frontend. I also used the BootStrap library and icons from FontAwesome. In the backend, I used express to create APIs. With Heroku, MongoDB Atlas, and Netlify, I was able to create a full CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) application. I intend of updating it as I learn more developer languages and skills both in the frontend and backend.
